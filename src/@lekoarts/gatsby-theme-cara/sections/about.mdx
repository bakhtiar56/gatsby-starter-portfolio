## About

> I am currently a CS BS student with an interest in developing MERN stack applications and improving my skillset. I have experience in
> building a MERN stack application for my course project while collaborating with my groupmates. I am also learning Machine Learning which is also another exciting new field with its own innovations and set of challenges.

I am always looking for a room to improve, including embracing teamwork and getting out of my comfort zone.
I also love swimming and going out for a run!
